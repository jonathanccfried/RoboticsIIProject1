localize.m, mapping.m and slam.m are the implementations for each problem. The utilities folder has been taken from Professor Wen's sample code and used as is (to solve the interception of two circles). It should be in the matlab path for the three programs to roll.

localize.m solves the localization problem for the conditions initiated at the beginning of the file.
plotloc.m plots its results and calculates the mean-squared error of the estimation.

mapping.m and plotmap.m do a similar task, for the mapping problem.

slam.m and plotslam.m, do a similar task, for the combined SLAM problem.
