localize.m, mapping.m and slam.m are standalone functions.

localize.m solves the localization problem for the conditions initiated at the beginning of the file.
plotloc.m plots its results and calculates the mean-squared error of the estimation.

mapping.m and plotmap.m do a similar task, for the mapping problem.

slam.m and plotslam.m, do a similar task, for the combined SLAM problem.
